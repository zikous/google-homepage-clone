# Google Homepage Replica

A fun little project to replicate the Google homepage with a search bar and buttons!

## What’s Included:

- Google logo at the top
- A search bar with an icon inside
- Two buttons: "Google Search" and "I’m Feeling Lucky"
- A navigation bar with links like "About," "Google Store," "Gmail," and "Images"
- Footer with links like "Advertising," "Business," "Privacy," and "Terms"

## How to Use:

1. Download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the replica of the Google homepage.

## Fun Fact:

This is just for fun and doesn't actually do anything when you click the search buttons, but it looks like the real Google homepage!

Enjoy building and customizing it further!

## Note:

This project is **not yet fully optimized for mobile responsiveness**. Adjustments to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices are still needed.
